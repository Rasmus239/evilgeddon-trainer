evilgeddon-trainer
==================

This is a simple trainer created in C# for Evilgeddon Spooky Max.

What it does:
Listening for keypresses (F1), when you press down the button it will send a message into the focused window.

The first message is "gangnamstyle" which heals you.
The second message is "shitjustgotreal" which gives you ammunition.

Why i made this trainer:
It's easier to just press one button instead of typing the whole sentence twice.
